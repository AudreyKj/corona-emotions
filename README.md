# CORONA EMOTIONS CLUB - React app about COVID-19

In this React app, users share their personal experiences of the COVID-19 outbreak and browse through others' submissions. An "admin" page (made with chart.js) visualizes the data of the submissions by date and location. <br />

This project's intention is to collect personal, emotional, yet global, perspectives on the situation.
When all this is over, I hope that it could serve as a digital archive reminding us of this very strange time.
