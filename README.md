# React app about COVID-19

This React app is a collective gathering of emotions related to the
COVID-19 outbreak. <br /> <br />

Users can submit all the fears, dreams,
hopes they have regarding the situation and browse through the collection
to see others’ submissions. <br /> <br /> This website’s intention is to
collect personal, emotional, yet global, perspectives on the situation.
When all this is over, I'm hoping that it could serve as a digital
archive reminding us of this very strange time.
<br /> <br />
