This React app enables users to express their feelings about the COVID-19 outbreak and browse through others' submissions.<br /> <br />
This project's intention is to collect personal, emotional, yet global, perspectives on the situation.
When all this is over, I'm hoping that it could serve as a digital
archive reminding us of this very strange time.
